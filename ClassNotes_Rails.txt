** When creating inside another git repository, it's needed to delete
.git file, what will do it to use of the parente structure
>>rails new will create git repo files

1) rails new project_name
   rails new project_name -T -d postgresql  (if need db - use Postgres as our database instead of the default one: SQLite)
2) check if it will have a own git repo, if not, delete .git
3) rails g model question title body:text
4) rails db:migrate
5) rails g controller question
6) create function at controller(s)
7) create erb files
5) rails s  (runs the server)
9) edit file new in view
10) add the option for the nav in application.html.erb inside (layouts)
11) implement in routes file an option for new


rails db:migrate
rails g migration add_view_count_to_questions  view_count:integer

****rails g controller question --no-helper --no-assets
create controller with less options inside assets folder
