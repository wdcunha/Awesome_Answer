    #

    # The first argument to `can` is the action you are giving the user
    # permission to do.
    # If you pass :manage it will apply to every action. Other common actions
    # here are :read, :create, :update and :destroy.
    #
    # The second argument is the resource the user can perform the action on.
    # If you pass :all it will apply to every resource. Otherwise pass a Ruby
    # class of the resource.
    #
    # The third argument is an optional hash of conditions to further filter the
    # objects.
    # For example, here the user can only update published articles.
    #
    #   can :update, Article, :published => true

    # It the `Ability` we define authorization rules, the first argument
    # is a symbol that represent an ability to do something and the second
    # argument is the subject. In other words, it's the model that would be
    # affected by the action.

    # can define your own names.
