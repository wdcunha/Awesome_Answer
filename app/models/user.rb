  # `has_secure_password` is a built-in Rails method for models that
  # provides user authentication features:
  # 0. It will add two attribute accessors for `password` and
  #    `password_confirmation`.
  # 1. It will automatically add a presence validator for the password field
  # 2. When given a password, it will hash it with bcrypt and save it in
  #    the `password_digest` column.
  # 3. It will add the instance method `authenticate` which can be used to
  #    to verify a user's password. If the correct password is entered,
  #    it will return the authenticated user otherwise it will return `false`.

  # also only contains valid characters.
